# Video-Stream-Processing
Video Stream Processing :  A Distributed stream processing
This repository implements a real-time video processing application built using Apache Storm. It leverages distributed computing principles to process video frames in parallel, apply image filters, and aggregate the results.

## Project Overview

The Video-Stream-Processing application is designed to perform several image processing operations on video files using Apache Storm. The application reads a video file, processes each frame by applying filters like Gaussian blur and sharpening, and then combines these frames to produce an output video that highlights the effects of these operations.


## Project Goals

* Design a stream processing application with Apache Storm to perform real-time image processing on video files.
* Showcase distributed computing by processing video frames concurrently and applying filters.
* Aggregate results like average brightness and total frame count.

## Technologies Used

* **Primary Framework:** Apache Storm
* **Programming Language:** Java (recommended) or any other compatible language
* **Additional Library:** OpenCV for Java (image processing)
